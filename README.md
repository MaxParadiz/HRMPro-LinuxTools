Very simple, minimal script that allows you to print the heart rate measured by Garmin's HRM-Pro strap.

Replace the MAC address with the address of your HRM-Pro strap. 


Run this in the terminal as sudo python HeartRate.py (sudo needed for establishing bluetooth connection) and your measured heart rate will be printed every second.
